Read the board address.

The actuator boards are arranged from rear to head of the CuddleBot
in the following order:

        Conn     ADDR0/1    Slave              H1 H0 L1 L0    ADDR
Rear    CN105    VCC HIZ    ADDR_RIBS          1  1  0  1    0x10
        CN107    VCC VCC    ADDR_PURR          1  1  1  1    0x08
        CN103    VCC GND    ADDR_SPINE         0  1  0  1    0x04
        CN102    GND VCC    ADDR_HEAD_YAW      1  0  1  0    0x02
Head    CN101    GND GND    ADDR_HEAD_PITCH    0  0  0  0    0x01

These values were measured rather than calculated.

This function should be invoked during system initialization and
before configuring interrupt handlers and higher priority threads.
